The DataCite Consortium
=====================================

Scholarly research is producing ever-increasing amounts of digital research data and it depends on data
to verify research findings, create new research, and share findings. In this context, what has been
missing until recently is a *persistent* approach to access, identification, sharing, and re-use of datasets. To
address this need, the DataCite [1]_ international consortium was founded in late 2009 with these three
fundamental goals:

* establish easier access to scientific research data on the Internet,
* increase acceptance of research data as legitimate, citable contributions to the scientific record, and
* support data archiving that will permit results to be verified and re-purposed for future study.

Since its founding in 2009, DataCite has grown and now spans the globe from Europe and North America
to Asia and Australia. The aim of DataCite is to provide domain-agnostic services to benefit scholars in a
wide range of disciplines.

Key to DataCite service is the concept of a long-term or *persistent* identifier. A persistent identifier is an
association between a character string and a resource. Resources can be files, parts of files, persons,
organisations, abstractions (concepts in a taxonomy, e.g.), and so on. DataCite uses *Digital Object
Identifiers* (DOIs). [2]_
