DataCite Community Participation
=====================================

The Metadata Working Group would like to acknowledge the contributions to our work of many
colleagues in our institutions who provided assistance of all kinds. Their help has been greatly
appreciated. In addition, we are indebted to numerous individuals and organisations in the broader
scholarly community who have taken an interest in this work. Because data citation and data
management are evolving areas of concern, we look forward to continued interest. With this in mind,
the Working Group provides an interactive discussion mechanism for DataCite members and clients to
discuss the DataCite Metadata Schema and issues connected with metadata submitted to DataCite, as
appropriate [3]_.
