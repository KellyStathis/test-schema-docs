Version 4.5 Update
====================

.. note::
   For the first time, the DataCite Metadata Working Group is releasing the DataCite Metadata Schema documentation as web documentation.

   To access the documentation in PDF or Epub format, access the menu in the bottom left corner or the links below:

   - PDF: https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/4.5_draft/pdf/
   - Epub: https://datacite-metadata-schema.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/4.5_draft/epub/

   To make the DataCite Metadata Schema more easily usable on the web, we have updated the documentation structure. As a result, numbering for footnotes, tables, and selected appendices has changed from Version 4.4.

.. note::

   *To do: Summarize updates.*

Schema changes
-----------------------------

* Addition of a new :doc:`Distribution </properties/recommended_optional/property_distribution>` property. Subproperties:

   * :ref:`mediaType <21.a>`
   * :ref:`contentUrl <21.b>`
   * :ref:`lastUpdated <21.b.1>`
   * :ref:`byteSize <21.b.2>`
   * :ref:`checkSum <21.c>`
   * :ref:`algorithm <21.c.1>`
   * :ref:`accessRights <21.d>`
   * :ref:`accessRightsUri <21.d.1>`

Documentation changes
-----------------------------

* To enhance support for the Distribution property, addition of a new guidance document: :doc:`/guidance/distribution`




New documentation structure
-----------------------------

We have relocated some content to two new sections:

- :doc:`Guidance </guidance/index>`
- :doc:`Mappings </mappings/index>`

These sections may be updated more frequently than the metadata schema itself.
