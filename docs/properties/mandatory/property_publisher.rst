4. Publisher
====================

**Occurrences:** 1

**Definition:** The name of the entity that holds, archives, publishes prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces the resource.

If there is an entity other than a code repository, that "holds, archives, publishes, prints, distributes, releases, issues, or produces" the code, use the property Contributor/contributorType/ hostingInstitution for the code repository.

**Allowed values, examples, other constraints:**

Examples: World Data Center for Climate (WDCC); GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam (GFZ); Geological Institute, University of Tokyo, GitHub
